## üöÄ Getting Started

### üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ (3.9+ recommended).
- Recommended IDE: Visual Studio Code (but any IDE will work).

### üì• Installation

1. **Clone** the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/arunpshankar/VertexAIDocExplorer.git
```

2. **Navigate** to the project directory:
```bash
cd VertexAIDocExplorer
```

3. **Set Up Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

4. **Install Dependencies**:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. **Update your PYTHONPATH**:
```bash
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:.
```

### üìò Usage

Navigate to the `src/` directory to explore the source code. Begin with the `config` folder, which includes:

- `config.yml`: Configuration settings (e.g., GCP project ID, credentials).
- `doc-search-queries.jsonl`: Queries to evaluate document search results.
- `site-search-queries.jsonl`: Queries to evaluate site search results.
- `topics.jsonl`: Metadata for classifying PDF URL links.
- `sites.jsonl`: List of sites to index with VertexAI search.

The `run/` directory houses scripts for testing and evaluation:

- `site_search.py`: Finds PDFs across indexed sites.
```bash
python src/run/site_search.py
```

- `pruner.py`: Prunes site search results by classification.
```bash
python src/run/pruner.py
```

- `downloader.py`: Downloads PDFs from pruned URL links.
```bash
python src/run/downloader.py
```

- `uploader.py`: Uploads PDFs to Google Cloud Storage.
```bash
python src/run/uploader.py
```

- `doc_search.py`: Searches documents, returning relevant passages and answers.
```bash
python src/run/doc_search.py
```

- `evaluate.py`: Evaluates the explorer for site and document searches.
```bash
python src/run/evaluate.py
```

- `generate_reports.py`: Converts evaluation results to Excel sheets.
```bash
python src/run/generate_reports.py
```

üîç **Note:** Prior to site searching, create a search app and data store using the site list. Before document searching, set up a search app pointing to the GCS bucket containing the PDFs from `downloader.py`.

## Getting Started with Evaluation

In the `config` directory of the project repository, you will find the following JSONL files containing query examples for evaluation:

- `doc-search-queries.jsonl`: Contains queries related to document search.
- `site-search-queries.jsonl`: Contains queries related to site search.

Feel free to augment these files with additional queries as necessary.

## Running the Evaluation

To initiate the evaluation process:

1. Finalize the JSONL files with your queries.
2. Navigate to `src/run/evaluate.py` to execute the search against both site and document datasets.
3. Results will be saved in `data/evaluate/site-search-results.jsonl` and `doc-search-results.jsonl`.

## Generating Reports

After running the evaluation:

1. Run `src/run/generate-reports.py` to convert the JSONL results into Excel format.
2. The spreadsheets will be saved alongside the JSONL files with a `.xlsx` extension.

## Labeling the Results

With the Excel files ready:

1. Add a new column titled 'HUMAN LABEL' to both spreadsheets.
2. Begin labeling the site search and doc search results for relevance.

## Evaluation Criteria

For site-search results:

- Check if the URLs match the specified company and topic for a given query.

For doc-search results:

- Evaluate if the search results match relevant document segments and provide appropriate abstractive answers.

## Metrics for Evaluation

We employ several metrics to quantify the evaluation:

- **Precision (p)**
- **Precision at k (p@k)** (with k being 1, 3, and 5)
- **Mean Reciprocal Rank (mrr)**
- **Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (ndcg)** (including ndcg@3 and ndcg@5)

To calculate these metrics, utilize `src/metrics/site-search.py` and `src/metrics/doc-search.py`. These scripts will compute the scores based on the labeled Excel files.

## Results

The final evaluation metrics will be stored in:

- `data/metrics/site-search-evaluation-by-metrics.csv`
- `doc-search-evaluation-by-metrics.csv`

These files will help you understand the quality of the search results across various queries.
