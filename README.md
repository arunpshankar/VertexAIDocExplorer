   cd VertexAIDocExplorer
   ```

3. **Set Up Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Update your PYTHONPATH**:
   ```bash
   export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:.
   ```

### üìò Usage

[Your step-by-step guide on how to use the application will fit perfectly here!]

Navigate to the `src/` folder to view the project's source code. Get started by exploring the `config` folder:

- `config.yml`
- `doc-search-queries.jsonl` - Queries needed for evaluating document search results.
- `site-search-queries` - Queries for evaluating site search results (document sourcing).
- `topics.jsonl` - Contains metadata for classifying PDF URL links identified by site search for a given query.
- `sites.jsonl` - Collection of sites to index by VertexAI search.

The `run/` directory contains:

- `site_search.py` - Finds matching PDFs across indexed sites from `sites.jsonl`.
   ```bash
   $ python src/run/site_search.py
   ```

- `pruner.py` - Prunes site search results by classification into topics using text bison LLM.
   ```bash
   $ python src/run/pruner.py
   ```

- `downloader.py` - Downloads PDFs from pruned URL links asynchronously to local disk.
   ```bash
   $ python src/run/downloader.py
   ```

- `uploader.py` - Uploads downloaded PDFs from local storage to Google Cloud Storage (GCS).
   ```bash
   $ python src/run/uploader.py
   ```

- `doc_search.py` - Performs document search, finding relevant passages and generating answers with citations.
   ```bash
   $ python src/run/doc_search.py
   ```

- `generate_reports.py` - Transforms evaluation output results from JSONL format to human-readable Excel sheets.
   ```bash
   $ python src/run/generate_reports.py
   ```

**Note:** Before performing site search, create a search app and data store using the list of sites. Similarly, before performing document search, create a search app by pointing to the GCS bucket containing the PDFs downloaded by `downloader.py`.
