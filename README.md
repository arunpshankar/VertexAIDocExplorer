### üìò Usage

Navigate to the `src/` directory to view the project's source code. Begin by exploring the `config` folder, which contains:

- `config.yml`: Configuration for GCP project ID, credentials, and other settings.
- `doc-search-queries.jsonl`: Queries for evaluating document search results.
- `site-search-queries.jsonl`: Queries for evaluating site search results.
- `topics.jsonl`: Metadata for classifying PDF URL links.
- `sites.jsonl`: Collection of sites to index with VertexAI search.

The `run/` directory contains scripts for testing and evaluating:

- `site_search.py`: Finds PDFs across indexed sites.
   ```bash
   python src/run/site_search.py
   ```

- `pruner.py`: Prunes site search results by classification.
   ```bash
   python src/run/pruner.py
   ```

- `downloader.py`: Downloads PDFs from pruned URL links.
   ```bash
   python src/run/downloader.py
   ```

- `uploader.py`: Uploads PDFs to Google Cloud Storage.
   ```bash
   python src/run/uploader.py
   ```

- `doc_search.py`: Performs document search with relevant passages and answers.
   ```bash
   python src/run/doc_search.py
   ```

- `evaluate.py`: Evaluates the explorer for both site and document search.
   ```bash
   python src/run/evaluate.py
   ```

- `generate_reports.py`: Converts evaluation results to Excel sheets.
   ```bash
   python src/run/generate_reports.py
   ```

**Note:** Before performing site search, create a search app and data store using the list of sites. Before performing document search, create a search app pointing to the GCS bucket with the PDFs from `downloader.py`.
